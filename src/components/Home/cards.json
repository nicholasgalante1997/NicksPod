    "desc": "Solid is an open standard for structuring data, digital identities, and applications on the Web. Solid aims to support the creation of the Web as Sir Tim Berners-Lee originally envisioned it when he invented the Web at CERN in 1989. Tim sometimes refers to Solid as “the web - take 3\" — or Web3.0 — because Solid integrates a new layer of standards into the Web we already have. The goal of Solid is for people to have more agency over their data.",
