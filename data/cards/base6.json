While in play, Mysterious Fossil counts as a Pokémon (instead of a Trainer card). Mysterious Fossil has no attacks, can't retreat, and can't be affected by Special Conditions. If Mysterious Fossil is Knocked Out, it doesn't count as a Knocked Out Pokémon. (Discard it anyway.) At any time during your turn before your attack, you may discard Mysterious Fossil from play. You can put Pokémon that evolve from Mysterious Fossil on this card."],"set":{"id":"base6","name":"Legendary Collection","series":"Other","printedTotal":110,"total":110,"legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"ptcgoCode":"LC","releaseDate":"2002/05/24","updatedAt":"2020/08/14 09:35:00","images":{"symbol":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/symbol.png","logo":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/logo.png"}},"number":"109","artist":"Keiji Kinebuchi","rarity":"Common","legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"images":{"small":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/109.png","large":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/109_hires.png"},"tcgplayer":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/tcgplayer/base6-109","updatedAt":"2024/08/02","prices":{"normal":{"low":0.21,"mid":0.5,"high":2.99,"market":0.48,"directLow":null},"reverseHolofoil":{"low":23.33,"mid":32.49,"high":49.99,"market":22.9,"directLow":null}}},"cardmarket":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/cardmarket/base6-109","updatedAt":"2024/08/02","prices":{"averageSellPrice":0.26,"lowPrice":0.02,"trendPrice":0.11,"germanProLow":0,"suggestedPrice":0,"reverseHoloSell":10,"reverseHoloLow":12.9,"reverseHoloTrend":11.7,"lowPriceExPlus":0.08,"avg1":0.2,"avg7":0.29,"avg30":0.46,"reverseHoloAvg1":10,"reverseHoloAvg7":19.55,"reverseHoloAvg30":22.8}}},{"id":"base6-110","name":"Potion","supertype":"Trainer","rules":["Remove up to 2 damage counters from 1 of your Pokémon."],"set":{"id":"base6","name":"Legendary Collection","series":"Other","printedTotal":110,"total":110,"legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"ptcgoCode":"LC","releaseDate":"2002/05/24","updatedAt":"2020/08/14 09:35:00","images":{"symbol":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/symbol.png","logo":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/logo.png"}},"number":"110","artist":"Keiji Kinebuchi","rarity":"Common","legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal","standard":"Legal","expanded":"Legal"},"images":{"small":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/110.png","large":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/110_hires.png"},"tcgplayer":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/tcgplayer/base6-110","updatedAt":"2024/08/02","prices":{"normal":{"low":0.1,"mid":0.25,"high":10000,"market":0.24,"directLow":0.17},"reverseHolofoil":{"low":19,"mid":23.89,"high":35.99,"market":28.99,"directLow":null}}},"cardmarket":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/cardmarket/base6-110","updatedAt":"2024/08/02","prices":{"averageSellPrice":0.17,"lowPrice":0.02,"trendPrice":0.15,"germanProLow":0,"suggestedPrice":0,"reverseHoloSell":0,"reverseHoloLow":25,"reverseHoloTrend":21.16,"lowPriceExPlus":0.02,"avg1":0.07,"avg7":0.13,"avg30":0.13,"reverseHoloAvg1":0.15,"reverseHoloAvg7":20.69,"reverseHoloAvg30":22.16}}}]}
